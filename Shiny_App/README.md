# Food Safety Sampling Simulation
This is a repository created by maintained by Xianbin (Eric) Cheng, and maintained by memeber sof the Stasiewicz lab at the University of Illinois. It is built for a projects supported by: (i) International Life Science Institute North America (ILSI N.A.) Food Microbiology Committee under the title "Simulating Larg-Number Bulk-Product Sampling to Improve Food Safety Sampling Plans". (ii) Center for Produce safety (CPS) under the title "Simulation analysis of in-field produce sampling for risk-based sampling plan development"

## Objective
We are looking to build a model that takes various input parameters that are relevant to food safety scenarios and returns metrics that are associated with food safety risk. 

## Introduction
The simulation model has 2 modes: continuous mode and discrete mode. The continuous mode is intended for sampling in a 2D field whereas the discrete mode is designed for sampling in a 3D space. As the project is based on food safety scenarios, all sampling strategies and sampling plans used in the simulation are in alignment with US food safety regulations, like attribute sampling plans designated by ICMSF and mycotoxin sampling protocols designated by USDA.

## How to use
Please refer to the WORD document for instruction for downloading the target version. Then, choose the right R Markdown file to run the simulation.

## Caution
The simulation model is under development. There might be unexpected bugs when running the simulation.
